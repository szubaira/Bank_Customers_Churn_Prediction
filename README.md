# Bank Customers' Churn Prediction
Machine Learning Project

- Generated a Customer Churn Analysis for bank customers in order to help banks implement new services or improve existing ones with a strategy that will retain customers who are most likely to churn from their business. 
- Visualized all of the features and their relationship with our target variable to better understand the dataset and the impact of each feature on the likelihood that a customer will exit from business services. 
- Modeled and optimized Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, Gradient Booster Classifier, XG Boosting, Light Gradient Boosting Machine, and Ensemble Learning Algorithm using GridSearchCV and k-fold cross-validation technique to find the best model fit. 
- Compared the performance of all the models using four performance metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, ROC-AUC) to select a Machine Learning classifier with highest overall model performance.
